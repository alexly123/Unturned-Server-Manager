# Unturned-Server-Manager
A program for automatically deploying and updating an Unturned server on windows.




Built as a standalone program for my own server.
Will use batch to produce all of the files it needs to operate.
Allows you to produce a clean, easy to manage server for Unturned.
Updates Unturned, rocket, and any rocket mods.


.... Current features:

Fast deploy of an Unturned server using SteamCMD.

Easy update of Unturned, Rocket, and all your plugins with one button!

Clean organization of server files.

Assists with all you need to get your server up and running.

You must change all the server settings under "unturned\Servers\ManagedServer"

.... Current limitations:

ONE server limit. I may change this, but it is doubtful because that is hard to implement.

Ensuring ports are forewarded and such are done by you for the server to function.



.... Future plans:

Automatic Updating system.

Self maintaining system

<<<<<<< HEAD
Automatic program updating system.

>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
(by this point the server when set up properly shouldn't ever need matenience!) :)

Scheduled command making system. (Almost a custom plugin making system! No coding needed!)
  
Choosing where plugin files go.

Seperate file download and choosing where it does system.
